## Final Notes

Your role is unique in that you are implementing both divination features and the app's online capabilities. The numerology, I Ching, and Abjad features add important diversity to the divination methods, while the Firebase integration provides enhanced functionality for users who choose to use online features.

Remember that all Firebase features must be strictly optional, enhancing the experience without becoming required. The app should function fully offline, with cloud features presented as beneficial additions.

Please reach out if you have questions about the calculation methods, Firebase implementation strategies, or integration with other features.
